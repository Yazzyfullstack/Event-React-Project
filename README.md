# Event-React-Project

This app is an React Advanced assignment in the Fullstack-developer course at Winc Academy , The Netherlands. 
The aim is to make an event- app for viewing, editing, updating and deleting events. 

For this project I used:
- Chakra UI for the styling of the app 
- A mock API using JSON-server
- React Router to structure the pages within the app 
- Components
